The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of \nthe great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many \nparticipants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, \nblurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, \nenabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear \nweapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in \nan estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to \ngenocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis \ndefeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted \nagainst German and Japanese leaders. \nThe causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-\nEthiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border \nconflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. \nWorld War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, \nunder Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war \non Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany \nand the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across \nFinland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of \ncampaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a \nmilitary alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of \ncampaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued \nprimarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, \nthe aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 \nJune 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening \nthe Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history. \nJapan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by \n1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-\nsimultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on \nthe U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring \nwar against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. \nJapan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after \nlosing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at","metadata":{"source":"./controllers/World War 2.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":33}}}}],["ffeb531d-1127-497f-ad52-3c871e268dcd",{"pageContent":"Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on \nthe Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in \nthe Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all \nfronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union \nregained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, \nJapan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and \ncaptured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of \nGerman-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet \nUnion, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide, and the German \nunconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the \nterms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first \natomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. \nFaced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional \natomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve \nof invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a \nsurrender document on 2 September 1945.","metadata":{"source":"./controllers/World War 2.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":35,"to":50}}}}]],{"0":"6d03a526-5826-4b88-ac39-a3b78db9e29a","1":"ffeb531d-1127-497f-ad52-3c871e268dcd"}]
